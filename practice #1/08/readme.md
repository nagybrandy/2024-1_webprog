# ÉRETTSÉGI - TASK A

Before we dive into the topic, let's look at some basic facts and rules that apply to the writing skills section:

1. This is the only part of the written exam where you can use Hungarian-English, English-Hungarian, and monolingual dictionaries. So, don't let this be the first day you have a dictionary in your hand because you can waste a lot of time if you don't handle your dictionary properly.

2. A short letter under 25 words is invalid, so zero points can be awarded. Also, no points can be given for the entire short letter if you fail to meet any of the given criteria.

3. One point should be deducted for under- and over-performance. This means more or less than plus and minus 10% of the given length. It may not be much, but even your acceptance could depend on it, so always count at the end.

4. It cannot be emphasized enough that this is the last part of a long exam when you may already be tired and distracted. You can easily gather the maximum 11 points, so it's not worth exaggerating or slapping together this short little letter.

What types of letters can be expected for short letters?
Basically, any type, although this may sound strange, I suppose, since one expects that it can only be one way or another. Often you need to invite someone somewhere, or accept an invitation, often to decline. You need to react to advertisements, but you may also need to apply very briefly for jobs and courses. It is very important that the most common given length is 50-80 words, which allows for quite limited space for maneuvering, so only the most essential messages should be written concisely. At the same time, be careful not to start writing in simple sentences due to the limited length.

We are now analyzing and solving the short letter of the 2012 May graduation. The task briefly is that you need to ask your English teacher for advice on what book to buy at that antique shop you stumbled upon during your vacation. Let's see:

Task A

You are on a two-week holiday in the UK. You have found a very good second-hand bookshop in Rochester, and you want your English teacher's advice about what books to get.

Write and email of 50-80 words to your English teacher, Mr. Hughes, in which you:
- explain why you are writing to him
- tell him what kinds of books you are interested in
- ask his advice about what to buy

Begin your email like this:
Dear Mr Hughes,
Let's not beat around the bush too much, let's get to the point! What we absolutely must know is that you have to fulfill every single request of the task. What does this include? First of all, you need to let him know that you want to ask for his advice. Furthermore, the points listed with dashes need to be fulfilled one by one. The requested email opening (in this case, Dear Mr Hughes) also needs to be written. It is advisable to skip a line between the introductory-discussion-concluding parts, as points are also awarded for writing style. It is also worth doing this after the greeting, as well as before the farewell.

Just like with any other type of letter, start with a greeting and explain why you are writing to the recipient. This doesn't need to be emphasized separately here, as the first point requests it:

Dear Mr Hughes,

I am writing to you because I am on a holiday in the UK and I found a second-hand bookshop and I need your help about what books to get.
Since the first point had to be mentioned in the first paragraph, only the other two need to be fulfilled in the "discussion" part:

I like different kinds of books, including comics, action books, and dramas. I would be grateful if you could give me some advice about what to buy.
At the end, you just need to thank him for his time with one of the well-known closing formulas and maybe also mention that you are eagerly awaiting his reply! The farewell can be somewhat "friendly" as it is a more relaxed letter. It's a good idea to put your full name at the end, and preferably in Western order.

Thank you very much for your advice and I am looking forward to your reply.

Best wishes,

Tamás Levélíró

# Érettségi - Writing TASK B

Before we delve into the topic, let's go through some basic facts and rules that apply to the writing skills section:

1. This is the only part of the written exam where you can use Hungarian-English, English-Hungarian, and monolingual dictionaries. So, don't let this be the first day you have a dictionary in your hand because you can waste a lot of time if you don't handle your dictionary properly.

2. A long letter under 50 words is invalid, so zero points can be awarded. Also, no points can be given for the entire long letter if you fail to meet any of the given criteria.

3. One point should be deducted for under- and over-performance. This means more or less than plus and minus 10% of the given length. It may not be much, but even your acceptance could depend on it, so always count at the end.

4. It cannot be emphasized enough that this is the last part of a long exam, specifically the second and longer half, when you may already be tired and distracted. You can easily gather the maximum 22 points, so it's not worth exaggerating or slapping together this letter.

What topics can be expected for the long letter task?
Exclusively advisory letters. There hasn't been an exception so far; there has always been a need to give advice. Generally, we can read about the complaints of anonymous individuals on forums or blogs, and it may also happen that a friend writes to us in despair about some difficulty. Common topics include stress before exams or job interviews, working while in school, or advising a girl struggling with weight issues. There have been cases of helping with a friend's declining performance and behavior, or explaining how the student council works in our school and what advice we would give regarding that. Perhaps the most extreme case so far was when a girl complained to us that her boyfriend is much older, and angry parents are tearing them apart because of it. One thing's for sure, we'll likely get an exciting topic, which we may have a personal connection to, making writing easier.

Let's see a concrete example from the May 2012 graduation. The essence of the task is that a casual babysitter named Jody desperately posted on a forum because the children she supervises are having a row over the TV during her Friday evening shifts while the parents are out partying. To make matters worse, alongside the constant bickering, they want to watch Dr. House and CSI, which are strongly recommended for viewers over 16. Jody is worried that one of the children will get seriously hurt eventually and asks us for advice. Here's how the task looked:

Task B

You are a member of an internet forum called Student Job Problems. Now you have found the following post:

I regularly babysit three kids aged 5-8 (a boy, a girl, and their friend, another girl) while their parents go out on Friday night. There’s always a fight over the TV: the boy wants to watch Cartoon Network, the girl wants CSI, and their friend wants House MD (the last two are rated PG). They shout and fight, and I’m sure it won’t be long before one of them gets seriously hurt. I have no idea what to do – can you help me? I would appreciate your ideas.

(http://www.quose.com/)

Write a comment of 100-120 words to Jody’s post in which you

•say what you think of children watching TV all the time,
•give your opinion about what young children should not be allowed to watch,
•recommend two activities Jody could try with the children instead of watching TV.

Begin your comment like this:

Jody,

At the very beginning of the task, it's crucial to establish how we came into contact with the forum post, which is excellent for starting our letter. We mention the circumstances and even signal that we're about to give advice. Don't forget to address the recipient as requested:

Jody,

I am writing to you because I have found your post on an internet forum and I would like to give you some advice.
It's worth mentioning each criterion in a separate paragraph. The task is simple: we need to express our thoughts on the situation. We can easily do this using the SHOULD/SHOULDN'T auxiliary verb. Let's provide reasoning, as that makes the story complete!

First of all, I think / in my opinion, at this age, children shouldn’t watch television all the time because they need to hang out with friends and they might become addicted.
For the second criterion, we're asked to say what those kids shouldn't watch. We can do this excellently using the HAD BETTER / HAD BETTER NOT auxiliary verbs. Don't forget to justify what we say.

Secondly, young children had better not watch rated PGs since they get bad influences and some scenes may be disturbing.
For the last criterion, we just need to suggest alternatives to destructive, evil television! Here, we can use the IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD / WOULDN'T structure and thus provide three different pieces of advice in three different paragraphs WITHOUT REPETITION. And of course, let's justify!

Finally, if I were you, I would play hide-and-seek in the garden with the kids or you can also try board games instead of watching the telly. These activities can develop their minds and bodies.
We can leave a good impression at the end of the letter by expressing our hope that we could help and asking for updates on how things work out. Let's say goodbye in a friendly tone at the end and write our full name in English word order:

I really hope I could help and let me know how things work out.

Best wishes,

József Levélíró

Finally, let's see how the maximum 22 points are calculated:
We get 6 points for length and following the given criteria. 2 points are awarded for tone, making a good impression. Text composition, that is, healthy, beautiful sentences, coherent paragraphs, is worth 4 points. 5 points are for the appropriate, nuanced vocabulary, and another 5 points are for grammar and spelling.
